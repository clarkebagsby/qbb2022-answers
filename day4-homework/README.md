This simulation relates to the data from the McCoy lab because both measure the probabilty of detecting a deviation from the hypothesis or known as the power. The binomial test in the figure looks at the relationship between sperm size and transmission rate as it relates to transmission distortions in getting alleles from two parents. The power in thsi case describes how often the sperm does have the distrotion/ deviates from there being no distrortioons in a sample. Transmisson distrotions is the occurence of one allele being passed down to prgeny more often than another allele. 


The parallels I observe is that as sample size increases the power increases. This is due to the amount of deviaation increasing from the null hypothesis. 
prob_heads= number of sperms
n_toss=  transmission rate
n_iters= power 

A binomial test is used to explore the chances of the transmission distortions being affected by the number of sperms and rate of transmission. In the case of the coin flip it is used to see if the chances of it landing on heads or tails(2 possible outcomes)
