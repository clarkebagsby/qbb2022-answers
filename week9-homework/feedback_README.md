Great start! A few comments and things we need before this is complete:
1. For your qqplot, you need to manually set which distribution you want to compare against. The default distribution is a normal distribution, but do we expect pvals to be normally distributed? (-0.2 point)
2. You've gotten the transcripts from each model that are differentially expressed, but we need you to explicitly compare the overlap between the two sets of transcripts (-0.5 point)
3. We need your volcano plot for the model that includes sex. This should just be a scatter plot of -10log(pval) versus beta for each transcript. (-1 point)
