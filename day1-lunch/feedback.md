# Feedback

Question 2C - you also would need to sort the number of exons per gene to find the middle value of the sorted list

Question 3B - you should also have the list of # of regions per state, but your command is correct

Question 5C - That tally is correct for 0|0, so I think you know how to do it, but you're missing the tallies for 0|1, 1|0, and 1|1. You should also make sure to show your work (include what command you ran)

Question 5E - I'm not sure how you got to this number

All in all, you appear to be proficient in using the various bash tools and chaining them together to perform more complex tasks. You really need to always show your work, whether that means including the command or script that you used to get to the answer. You'll get much more useful feedback and we'll have a much better sense of what you've learned and it there are general confusions across the class. You're doing great, so keep it up! - MS
