Something went wrong with your command for Step 1C. Your output html file should have piecharts for each day, but currently it looks like it just has the pie chart from the last day (`SRR492197`). Your command doesn't look quite right, I think there should be some wildcard `*` characters in there if you want krona to process all the input files together. (-0.5 point)

For question 3B: you're correct that the bins only represent ~4-5% of the *contigs* in the assembly, but how much of the total genomic sequence do they represent (maybe the contigs in the bins are larger than the ones not included?) 

Excellent work overall!!
