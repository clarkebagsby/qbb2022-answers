# Week 1 Genome Assembly -- Feedback

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 points out of 10 possible points

1. Question 1.1, 1.4 how many reads (0.5 pts each)

  * **Regrade --> +1**

2. Question 1.2, 1.4 simulation script(s)

  * **Regrade --> +1**

3. Question 1.2, 1.4 plotting script(s)

  * **Regrade --> +1**

4. Question 1.2, 1.4 histograms with overlaid Poisson distributions (0.5 pts each)

  * **Regrade --> +1**

5. Question 1.3, 1.4 how much of genome not sequenced/comparison to Poisson expectations (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * **Regrade --> +1**

6. Question 2 De novo assembly (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * number of contigs --> **Regrade --> +0.5**
  * total length of contigs --> +0.5

7. Question 2 De novo assembly cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * size of largest contig --> +0.5
  * contig n50 size --> **Regrade --> +0.5 wonderful!**

8. whole genome alignment (0.33 pts each, 0.33/2 for answer and 0.33/2 for code)

  * average identity --> +0.33/2, code?
  * length of longest alignment --> +0.33/2, code?
  * how many insertions and deletions in assembly --> +0.33/2, code?
  * **regrade since the assignment says to use show-coords, I'm giving the points back on this**

9. decoding the insertion (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * position of insertion in assembly --> **regrade +0.5 since the assignment says to use show-coords, I'm giving the points back on this**
  * length of novel insertion --> 0.5


10. decoding the insertion cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * DNA sequence of encoded message --> +0.25, code is the right idea
  * secret message --> +0.25, code is the right idea

**regrade comments**

Fantastic work resubmitting this assignment.

For the secret message, if you remove the first base pair ("C"), I get the secret message that you report seeing. Without seeing the output you're using to answer questions 3 and 4, I can't be sure of this, but I would expect that location 26787 isn't included in the insertion and it starts at 26788. I'm going to give you the points for number 10 because I should have done a better job of looking through that the first time I graded.
