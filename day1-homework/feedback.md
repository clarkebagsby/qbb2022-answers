All of you answers appear correct. Good job getting a handle on using awk, that's tough for even seasoned pros. Again, you really need to make sure to include any commands you run as that is half of the answer. Hopefully after this you feel a little more comfortable looking online for solutions when debugging errors that arise. Great job!
